# Producer-Consumer
Submission of Producer/Consumer program for Joshua Sakal

To compile and run these programs, use:
g++ producer.cpp -pthread -lrt -o producer
g++ consumer.cpp -pthread -lrt -o consumer
./producer & ./consumer &

Code uploaded in the form of 'producer.cpp' for producer
and 'consumer.cpp' for consumer.

Written in the terminal of Linux Ubuntu 20.04.3 & GNOME Version 3.36.8

Code most likely doesn't work, as I got confused on 
shared memory and semaphores. I do not know enough 
about them and looking them up confused me. The attached 
files were the best I could do.
